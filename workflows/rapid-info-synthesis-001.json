First, identify the main themes or topics across all sources. Then, for each theme, extract the most important facts, insights, or arguments. Look for areas of consensus and disagreement among the sources. Highlight any particularly strong evidence or notable claims. Organize your findings in a structured format, clearly delineating between different themes and sources. Your output will be used in the next step to create a final summary."

Regardless of the format, ensure your summary includes: 1) A brief overview of the main findings, 2) Key insights or conclusions drawn from the analysis, 3) Any significant areas of consensus or disagreement among sources, and 4) At least three actionable recommendations or next steps based on the synthesized information. Tailor your language and level of detail to be appropriate for a professional knowledge worker audience. The summary should be self-contained and provide clear value without requiring reference to the original sources."
