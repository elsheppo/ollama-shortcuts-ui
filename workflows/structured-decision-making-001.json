Create a structured analysis that clearly compares the options across these dimensions. Look for any non-obvious implications or long-term consequences of each option. Your analysis should be objective and balanced, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses of each option. This analysis will be used in the next step to make a final recommendation."

Your output should include: 1) A brief summary of the decision context and key considerations, 2) Your recommended course of action, clearly stated, 3) A detailed rationale for your recommendation, referencing the analysis of how the chosen option best meets the criteria ({{criteria}}) and addresses stakeholder ({{stakeholders}}) needs, 4) Acknowledgment of the main risks or downsides of your recommended option and suggestions for mitigating them, 5) Brief explanations of why other options were not chosen, 6) Next steps or an action plan for implementing the decision. Your recommendation should be logically sound and demonstrate a balanced consideration of all factors, including the constraints ({{constraints}}).
